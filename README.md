I designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize BlinkIt sales data effectively. The dashboard integrates a variety of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to enable dynamic filtering and provide actionable insights across multiple dimensions of sales performance. By leveraging advanced visualizations, such as doughnut charts, bar charts, and clustered bar charts, the dashboard offers an intuitive and detailed view of critical metrics.

Key features include:
Daily Sales Trends: A clear representation of sales performance over time, enabling the identification of peak sales periods and trends.
Profit Analysis: Detailed insights into profit margins to support strategic financial planning and decision-making.
Average Sales Metrics: A focused analysis of average sales values, helping to gauge overall performance and customer purchasing behavior.
Item-Level Insights: Comprehensive data on the number of items sold, supporting inventory management and operational efficiency.
Interactive Filtering: Dynamic filters that allow users to drill down into specific regions, product categories, or timeframes for a more granular analysis.
This dashboard provides an interactive, user-friendly platform for stakeholders to track performance, uncover hidden patterns, and make data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and operational excellence.
